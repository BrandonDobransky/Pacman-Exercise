# Pacman-Exercise
This exercise was a fun example of using simple functions and callbacks to make a Pacman character move back and forth on your computer screen. Through the use of four different images, it looks like a very rudimentary version of a game as he "eats" his way across the screen.
##
To run this exercise, you can clone the files to your desktop and open with a browser or coding program. 
##
Some future improvements could include onClick features or adding additional Pacmen that respond to eachother
